Lightweight package for automatic differentiation.

Features
--------
Forward- and reverse-mode differentiation
    Fast computation of precise derivatives
    such as gradients and Jacobian-vector products.
Eager and lazy evaluation
    Immediate evaluation when creating expressions
    and on-demand re-evaluation.
Supports scalars, 1D and 2D NumPy arrays
    Linear algebra operations,
    element-wise operations, and
    broadcasting for scalars

Submodules
----------
scalar
    Automatic differentiation for scalars only
array
    Automatic differentiation for scalars, 1D and 2D NumPy arrays
